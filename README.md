# Sky-Spectre

Sky Spectre is a chess engine primarily programmed in C/C++ and rendered using the Raylib graphics library. The engine currently includes the following features:
- Board representation using bit arrays (bitboards)
- Fast move generation using bit manipulations
- Position evaluations using piece tables
- Varying depth search function using the min-max algorithm, optimized with alpha-beta pruning
- Transposition hash table for fast position lookup based on zobrist hash function
